# PRODIGY_DS_05

This is my first project (Task 5) from my internship at Prodigy InfoTech , where I dived into the exciting realm of Machine Learning. Here's a breakdown of what accomplished. 

Title: Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Description
This is a countrywide car accident dataset that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records. For more information about this dataset, please visit here.

Content
This dataset was collected in real-time using multiple Traffic APIs. It contains accident data collected from February 2016 to March 2023 for the Contiguous United States. For more details about this dataset, please visit [here].

Inspiration
The US-Accidents dataset can be used for numerous applications, such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accident hotspot locations, casualty analysis, extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful for studying the impact of COVID-19 on traffic behavior and accidents.

Sampled Data (New!)
For those requiring a smaller, more manageable dataset, a sampled version is available which includes 500,000 accidents. This sample is extracted from the original dataset for easier handling and analysis.

Other Details
Please note that the dataset may be missing data for certain days, which could be due to network connectivity issues during data collection. Regrettably, the dataset will no longer be updated, and this version should be considered the latest.

The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).
Dataset Information

I gathered datasets from this site https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing .This process laid the foundation for subsequent analysis. I split the dataset into training and testing subsets and proceeded to train a Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Model. The initial model demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy on the test set.
